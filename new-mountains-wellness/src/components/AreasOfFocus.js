        <h4>Pelvic Care</h4>
        <p>
          This work is designed to assess and restore the pelvic space of the female body. The vast majority of women have encountered shame and trauma around their pelvis, their sexuality, and their identity: birth trauma, sexual trauma, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual harassment, feelings of unsafety, emotional abuse, injuries, and more. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This longheld shame and trauma leaves the nervous system in a trauma-state, often leads to dissociation from the body and pelvic bowl,  and can cause physical pelvic symptoms (e.g. pelvic pain, incontinence, painful sex, and more). 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At New Mountains Wellness, I offer pelvic care through two different modalities. You might choose the one that seems best for you, or mix-and-match for a well-rounded treatment plan.
